["background-molecular-evolution.html", "2 Background: Molecular Evolution 2.1 Evolution in populations 2.2 Evolution in DNA 2.3 Fitness consequences of mutations", " 2 Background: Molecular Evolution Molecular evolution is the field of biology that studies how DNA and protein sequences evolve over long time scales, aka phylogenetic timescales. You can think of it as “molecular macroevolution” - the evolution of DNA/protein at the level of species. It’s “sister field” is Population Genetics (“popgen”), which is concerned with genetic change within species and populations. You may remember the “Allele A1” (or evolfoRces in my section!) simulations from “Introduction to Evolution” - this was population genetics. It considers how interacting forces of mutation, selection, migration, random genetic drift, recombination in sexual species, etc. shape the genetics of populations. Molecular evolution is more of a birds-eye-view of these processes. 2.1 Evolution in populations At the level of populations, we generally consider evolution as a process where: a) a random mutation occurs, and b) evolutionary forces act on the mutation. Over generations, one of several things will happen to this mutation: It will take over the population so that all individuals have it, aka it fixes, or goes to fixation in the population. We refer to fixed mutations as substitutions. This can happen either due to strong positive selection (selection really favors it!), or genetic drift (even mutations that are beneficial can fix in small populations where drift is strong enough). It will be lost from the population and no individuals will have it. From a birds-eye-view, then, it’s as though this mutation never even happened (keep this in mind!!). Mutations can be lost either due to negative selection (selection really does not like it), or it can be randomly lost due to genetic drift even if it’s not deleterious. While this process of either fixation or loss takes places, we would say that the mutation is segregating in the population. This means that some individuals will have it, and others will not (so it’s at some intermediate frequency), representing a polymorphism. If natural selection is not acting on the mutation (aka its fitness is “neutral”), or selection is acting so weakly that we can just as easily ignore it, we might describe the mutation as “drifting” through the population. Its frequency fluctuates over generations in the population just by chance. Again, given enough time, though, this mutation will eventually fix or be lost. When we take a phylogenetics or molecular evolution-oriented view of this process, mutations that are lost won’t make the cut - we only see mutations that end up fixing, aka substitutions. The figure below displays this outlook: On the left, we see a population of 7 dots. This population experiences mutations (red –&gt; blue for example), and some of these mutations fix while others are lost from the population. Zooming out of this process, we arrive at the right-side image. At a broad level, the entire population could be described as red -&gt; blue -&gt; orange. Green and purple were just blips on the radar that aren’t part of the long-term evolutionary process. 2.2 Evolution in DNA What is a mutation? It is a random (aka, not guided by a “need” for that mutation) mistake made during DNA replication. Those mutations that occur in the germ line (gametes: egg and sperm cells) are those that are relevant for evolution, since they can be passed on to the next generation. Somatic mutations, mutations which occur in literally any other cell of your body, happen regularly but usually are not a major issue. That said, cancer occurs when “enough” somatic mutations occur in genes involved in cell cycle control (cancer is actually an evolutionary process!). Broadly speaking, there are three kinds of mutations to think about at the molecular level. The wrong nucleotide is used during DNA replication, which ultimately changes the nucleotide. If this mutation fixes (and that’s all we care about!), we call it a substitution. Therefore, in phylogenetics, we actually refer to nucleotide changes as a whole as substitutions. Due to redundancy in the genetic code (there are multiple codons for most amino acids), there are several different consequences when a nucleotide is changed within a protein-coding region (aka exons, not introns) of the genome: A missense mutation also affects the translated protein product - the nucleotide mutation causes a change in the amino acid sequence. In evolutionary biology, we call this a nonsynonymous mutation. A silent mutation does not affect the translated protein product. We call this a synonymous mutation. A nonsense mutation creates a premature stop codon, and totally messes up the protein product. We generally “ignore” nonsense mutations over long evolutionary periods. What allows us to do this? Most of the time if you introduce a stop codon, the protein isn’t going to work, which usually means the individual who has that mutation has really low fitness (if even viable in the first place)! They won’t have offspring, and they won’t therefore be part of the evolutionary trajectory of the population. Therefore, over long time scales, we won’t even observe these types of mutations. Extra nucleotides are added during replication. This is called an insertion - some DNA is inserted. Similarly, some nucleotides can accidentally get skipped during replication. This is called a deletion - some DNA is deleted. Together, we refer to insertions and deletions as indels (pronounced like “incels” but with a “d”, sorry for the terrible reference point). Of course, when indels occur, there is going to be some kind of change to the final translated protein sequence. 2.2.1 A brief digression: SNPs There is a related vocabulary term to introduce at this time: Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, referred to as SNPs (“snips”). Note that evolutionary biologists tend to favor this term, but other fields like medical genomics might called it an “SNV” (pronounced as the letters S-N-V) for single nucleotide varient. A SNP is a type of polymorphism (different individuals in a population have different allele versions - nothing is fixed!!) that occurs at a single nucleotide. They are very commonly-studied type of variation within populations. From the birds-eye-view of phylogenetics, we generally “ignore” SNPs since we only are considering fixed mutations. (But should we? Unclear! Is it really bad to ignore these? In certain circumstances, maybe!! This is something I’d like to study!) 2.3 Fitness consequences of mutations As evolutionary biologists, we also like to think about how mutations affect an organism’s fitness: Is a given mutation more likely to be a a) beneficial or advantageous mutation that increases an organism’s fitness (“beneficial”), b) deleterious mutation that decreases an organism’s fitness, or c) neutral mutation that does not effect an organism’s fitness1. There has been a RAGEY debate in biology ongoing since the 1970s about this question. Here is a brief2 glimpse into the origins and camps of this debate: A very important biologist named Motoo Kimura introduced a framework called “The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution” in the late 1960s. At the time, most biologists assumed that the majority of mutations were deleterious - it is much more likely that a typo in DNA replication breaks something rather than helps something. Think of this like a typo: What are the odds your typo leads to a misspelled gibberish word vs a new and interesting vocabulary term? Odds are that you have a misspelling, not a new insight. Kimura, however, reasoned: If most mutations are bad, why is there so much natural variation in the world? Why do we see so many genetic polymorphisms in populations?3. Kimura wondered4 whether, in fact, this assumption that most mutations were deleterious was wrong: If mutations are usually bad, it shouldn’t be possible to see so much variation in species! Kimura still agreed that most mutations were unlikely to be advantageous, so his conclusion was that most mutations must be neutral, aka not influence fitness. Genetic drift would therefore be a dominant evolutionary force over natural selection. The jury is “still out” on whether mutations are primarily neutral or deleterious in their effect, but there are very serious and important people on either side of the debate who will assure you that “selectionists have won and the debate is over,” or conversely that “neutralists have won and the debate is over.” Of course, then, the debate rages on! In the chapter The Molecular Clock, we’ll talk more about the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution and how, even though it may or may not be the overall “rule” for how evolution works, it still is useful in many important circumstances. There are also so-called “nearly-neutral” mutations, which affect fitness but by such a tiny tiny amount that we can roughly consider them to be neutral.↩︎ An entire semester could be taught just on the background of this topic!↩︎ Of course, we did not have true DNA sequencing in the mid-1900s, but protein gels were pioneered and widely used to get broad-scale glimpses into genetic differences among individuals in populations↩︎ and did a LOT of math↩︎ "],

Over the years there have been many proposed routes: 1) distance-based. many types here. clustering methods like UPGMA, NJ. Minimum evolution. 2) parsimony. can be complex with more rules like types of changes are assigned different weights. directional mutations, etc. 3) model-based reconstruction. This is where we live.

Introduce back-mutations, parallel, etc here as a partial justification for why we use model-based. 3.3 Analyzing sequences in a phylogenetic context Once we have a tree, we can also use it for further model-based studies. We can ask…. 1) molecular clock analyses? 2) rate of evolution? 3) relationship between other traits and tree? 3.4 Gene tree vs species trees They are NOT the same.

["mutiple-sequence-alignments.html", "4 Mutiple sequence alignments", " 4 Mutiple sequence alignments Recall from the earlier section Evolution in DNA, that DNA mutations fall into two broad categories: a) substitutions (change in existing nucleotide(s)), and b) indels (nucleotides are inserted or deleted). In order to compare homologous sequences to one another, however, we need to line them up so they match. However, because of indels, two homologs are not necessarily going to have the same number of nucleotides. Some sequences will be shorter or longer, and sometimes by a lot.5. We therefore need to create something called a sequence alignment (a “character matrix,” which you may recall from “Introduction to Evolution”, but for DNA and protein sequences instead of physical traits). When you align two sequences together, it’s called a “pairwise alignment.” When there are three or more sequences (pretty much all modern-day evolutionary studies), it’s called a multiple sequence alignment, often abbreviated as “MSA” and simply referred to as “alignments”6 There are many different software programs which will align your homologous sequences. In the end, sequences will have both nucleotides (or amino acids, depending on your dataset), and gaps, represented as dashes (“-”), which represent indel events. Each site is a column in the alignment. MSAs are hard to make. Really, really hard. So hard in fact, that we are pretty sure that even the fanciest most computer-y algorithms for building MSAs are error prone. The problem is, the software doesn’t know about the evolutionary process itself and instead relies on mathematical optimization to get the “right” alignment. As a consequence, we are pretty sure a lot of alignments are wrong, but we also don’t know in what way they are wrong. To make matters worse, MSAs are THE fundamental unit of data used in all comparative sequence analyses and phylogenetics. Because alignments are known to be error-prone, a lot of people (including myself) have tried think about ways we can quantify this uncertainty, or at least identify unreliable regions in a given MSA. Some people advocate for strategies like trimming or filtering alignments, where you remove parts of the alignment you infer to be problematic. Usually, these are regions that are really “gappy” (yes, we really use this word!). Indels are what makes aligning so tricky - indeed, if there were no indels and only substitutions, all homologous sequences would already be the same length and directly line up into columns in the first place. There has been conflicting evidence over the years whether filtering improves or worsens analysis outcomes. It doesn’t seem to hurt, but it also doesn’t seem to help very much. What’s really interesting though is that even though protein sequences and lengths change over evolutionary time, their overall structure really does not. Natural selection imposes strong constraints on protein evolution to maintain a particular structure, which in turn allows the protein to properly function↩︎ CAUTION: There is another type of “alignment” in bioinformatics that is used for genome sequencing. The type of alignment we are concerned with is those that compare homologous sequences from DIFFERENT individuals/species.↩︎ "],

Imagine this simple example of two homologous sequences. This is shown in “FASTA” (pronounced either “fast-uh” or “fast-A”; I tend to say the former but there is no difference.) format: The name of the sequence is prefaced by a greater-than sign &gt;, and the subsequent line(s) contain the associated sequence. The next sequence record begins with the next &gt;. &gt;moose AGCTATAGAGCTA &gt;camel AACGATCGAGGTA All sequences are the same length (13 nucleotides) and presented as a multiple sequence alignment, so we can directly compare them. Looking column-by-column, there are 4 positions which differ between camel and moose and 9 that are the same. We would therefore say their percent identity is \\(9/13\\) (69.2%), and the percent difference (or proportion distance) is \\(4/13\\) (30.77%). We refer to the percent difference as a P-distance. We could also say that, considering these two sequences, 4 sites are variable and 9 sites are conserved. The problem with P-distance is that it’s calculated in a fairly naive manner if you are interested in the amount of evolutionary change. P-distance calculations make the assumption that each nucleotide difference is the result of a single substitution, and any unobserved differences are present because there were no substitutions ever at those sites. However, much like the honey badger, evolution does not care about simplicity. For example, consider position #1 where both species have the nucleotide A. The P-distance calculation assumes the most-recent common ancestor (MRCA) of camel and moose also had an A at this position, and nothing has changed since! This is quite a strong assumption, given evolution’s honey badger style. It is entirely possible that there WERE other changes that occured! Maybe the ancestor was a T and both camel and moose independently had a substitution to T. This would be an example of convergent molecular evolution. It is also entirely possible that the MRCA was an A, but along the evolutionary lineage to camels, the site substituted to G, then to T, and then back to A - this would be an example of multiple substitutions at a single site. In fact, we are more interested in measures of evolutionary divergence, which implies the total amount of evolutionary change, rather than simple distance calculations which only are able to consider observed and present nucleotide differences. We therefore desire a framework that can accommodate the serious possibility of complex and unobservable evolutionary histories. To do this, we use some fancier statistical models called Markov models. When we refer to “evolutionary” or “phylogenetic” models, this is what we mean!! 5.2 Markov models Most simply, Markov models (or processes) are comprised of probabilities (or rates) of instantaneous change among states….Huh? Let’s break this down… Working with nucleotides we have four states: A, C, G, and T! These are four things a DNA nucleotide can be. When a substitution occurs, nucleotides change into other nucleotides, and there is some probability a given nucleotide will change into another. In the simplest model, we would say there is an equal probability of any nucleotide changing to any other - the probability of mutating from A--&gt;G is the same as G--&gt;T is the same as T--&gt;A, and so on. We can write this out as a matrix called our instantaneous rate matrix, often referred to as the \\(Q\\) matrix. Note that we do not consider substitutions to the same state, e.g. A--&gt;A is assumed to never happen, since it doesn’t make sense, and therefore it has a probability of 0. Below, we use the parameter (fancy word for variable) \\(\\lambda\\) (Greek letter lambda) to represent the probability of each type of nucleotide substitution: It’s not complete yet! There is another aspect to consider: In addition to just the probability of changing from one nucleotide to another, there is some underlying probability of BEING a given nucleotide in the first place! The matrix above assumes that all nucleotides are equally likely in a given gene, but this isn’t always fair to expect. We therefore also include separate parameters for the so-called “base frequencies”, also known as “equilibrium” or “stationary” frequencies7. We represent these values with the Greek letter pi, \\(\\pi\\). Thus, the probability of a substitution from A--&gt;T is the \\(\\lambda\\), the probability that a nucleotide changes, weighted by the probability \\(\\pi_T\\) of observing the target nucleotide T in the first place. This is your very first Markov model!!! It has five parameters:\\(\\lambda\\), and the four values for \\(\\pi\\), one for each nucleotide8. However, this is pretty unrealistic: As biologists, we know that nucleotides aren’t all the same - there are purines (A and G) and pyrimidines (C and T). I will use \\(R\\) to mean purine and \\(Y\\) to mean pyrimidine. \\(R\\rightarrow R\\) and \\(Y\\rightarrow Y\\) mutations are known as transitions, and due to shared biochemistry, they occur much more easily than do transversions (\\(R\\rightarrow Y\\) or \\(Y\\rightarrow R\\)). We might want our model to reflect this biological information! We can do this by adding another parameter to our model that captures transition/tranversion bias - the underlying biological system’s preference for transitions over transversions. Commonly we represent this quantity with the Greek letter \\(\\kappa\\), kappa. We are in statistics world now which means everything is probabilities. What is the prob of mutation a -&gt; c? c-&gt; t? what about if we consider data at the protein level? prob tryp -&gt; tyro? Having a set of probabilities for these types of changes over time is our evolutionary model. Specifically, we use a framework called Markov. Introduce the word parameter as variable. Introduce the word estimate as it differs from parameter. 5.3 Background: Markov models and chains Weather example of rain/sunshine from bayesian class and show an example of a chain. Then an example of a chain with DNA. Memoryless, which lines up nicely with how we think evolution works. We often use “time-reversible” which means DNA evolution 5.4 Flavors (DNA, protein, codon) and applications 5.5 Phenomenological vs mechanistic 5.6 Origins: distance stuff from dayhoff and JC69 5.7 Choosing a model This is a broader concept in statistics: How do I choose a model for my data? What variables should I include, aka what level of complexity? We want to find the middle ground in under/overfitting and deal with the precision/bias tradeoff. Relative vs absolute. Relative says: I have a measure of “goodness-of-fit” and a family of candidate models I could use. We can rank them relative to one another. Absolute says: How well does this model recapitulate trends in my data? Also referred to as tests of model adequacy. DOes the model adequately describe my data? Finally the adage “All models are wrong but some are useful” and other useful Boxisms. Remember we are never going to actually model reality. There is actually quite a bit more math behind stationary frequencies, what they reall mean, and why we use them. We can discuss this separately if you really want the nitty gritty details, but the details aren’t strictly necessary for working with these models in my lab↩︎ A true phylogeneticist, however, would note there there are only four free parameters (aka parameters you need to understand the whole system): \\(\\lambda\\), and only THREE values for \\(\\pi\\)! Since all the \\(\\pi\\)’s must sum to 1 (there is a 100% chance of being any nucleotide), you only need to know three of those values to know the fourth. Sneaky!↩︎ "],

["assessing-confidence-in-phylogenetic-inferences.html", "7 Assessing confidence in phylogenetic inferences 7.1 Bootstrap and friends 7.2 PP", " 7 Assessing confidence in phylogenetic inferences Confidence measures exist under the assumption of the model used. Therefore they never represent “is this node right?” They represent “how well is my node supported under this given model of evolution?” It is support, or lack of support, towards each node which itself is a hypothesis under the model. 7.1 Bootstrap and friends We’d like more data to assess confidence, but we are stuck with the dataset we have. Booo. We use this concept sampling-with-replacement to do a bootstrap, so-called due to phrase “pull yourself up by bootstraps” - assess your confidence with the data you already got. In the MSA context, a given COLUMN is the unit of data for building the tree. So we make X new bootstrapped alignments, and build a tree under the model, and ask: In how many of those X trees is this split present? That is the bootstrap. 100 is common but with fancy schmancy computers 1000 has gotten more common. \\(\\geq70\\) considered to be reliable. There are other similar measures that have been developed over the years and literally are currently being developed. 7.2 PP Unlike ML where a single tree is spit out, bayesian gives you a distribution of trees from which a so-called “posterior probability” of observing that node can be deduced. These range from 0-1. They may however be totally borked - a lot of recent research has suggested that PP’s are inflated and way too high for spurious nodes and give some false security. "],
