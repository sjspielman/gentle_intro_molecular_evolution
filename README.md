**Work in progress!**

This repository contains an *extra-gentle* introduction to molecular evolution and phylogenetic analyses. The primary audience is undergraduate students who need background for research. This is *NOT* anywhere close to a comprehensive introduction to the field. I highly recommend [Molecular Evolution: A Statistical Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Evolution-Statistical-Ziheng-Yang/dp/0199602611) by Ziheng Yang for a proper in-depth and rigorous statistical treatment of molecular evolution background, theory, and application.
