# Introduction

**A WORK IN PROGRESS.** This document is temporary to organize the book, then will be split up into chapters with an associated `index.Rmd`.

With apologies to Bayesians, analyses is ML-focused. This book is geared towards my students. Read and use at your peril if you are not my student.

## Reading and interpreting phylogenies

## The pipeline of phylogenetic reconstruction

## Analyzing sequences in a phylogenetic context

# Pre-requisites

# Mutiple sequence alignments

# Evolutionary models

## Background: Markov models and chains

## Flavors (DNA, protein, codon) and applications

## Choosing a model

# Building your phylogeny

# Measuring evolutionary rates

## Nucleotide and protein relative rates

## Codon $dN/dS$ 

## Mutation-selection models
